## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** - Package manager
- **Git** - Version control

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL]
cd erm-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Database Setup
The database is automatically configured through Supabase migrations. The following tables will be created:
- `profiles` - User profile information
- `projects` - Project management data
- `assignments` - Engineer-to-project allocations

### 5. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## üóÑ Database Schema

- email (TEXT)
- name (TEXT)
- role (ENUM: 'manager', 'engineer')
- skills (TEXT[])

- max_capacity (INTEGER)
- department (TEXT)
```

#### `projects`
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)

## ü§ñ AI Development Process

### AI Tools Used
This project was developed using **Lovable AI**, an advanced AI editor specifically designed for web application development.

### How AI Accelerated Development

#### 1. **Rapid Prototyping**
- Generated complete React components in seconds
- Created consistent UI patterns across the application
- Automatically implemented responsive design principles

#### 2. **Database Design**
- AI generated comprehensive SQL migrations
- Implemented Row Level Security policies automatically
- Created proper foreign key relationships and constraints

#### 3. **Type Safety**
- Automatically generated TypeScript interfaces
- Created proper type definitions for all data structures
- Ensured type consistency across components

#### 4. **Styling & Animation**
- Applied modern UI design principles instantly
- Generated beautiful CSS animations and transitions
- Implemented consistent spacing and color schemes

### Specific AI Contributions

#### Component Generation
```typescript
// AI generated complete functional components like:
const Dashboard = () => {
  // Full implementation with hooks, state management, and UI
}
```

#### Database Migrations
```sql
-- AI created comprehensive database schema
CREATE TABLE public.profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  -- Complete table structure with proper constraints
);
```

#### Responsive Design
```css
/* AI applied consistent responsive patterns */
.grid-responsive {
  @apply grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6;
}
```

### Challenges Faced and Solutions

#### 1. **Type Definition Consistency**
- **Challenge**: AI sometimes generated components with mismatched TypeScript interfaces
- **Solution**: Created centralized type definitions in `src/types/index.ts`
- **Validation**: Regular TypeScript compilation checks

#### 2. **Database Policy Conflicts**
- **Challenge**: Row Level Security policies were too restrictive initially
- **Solution**: Iteratively refined policies based on application requirements
- **Testing**: Manual testing of CRUD operations for each user role

#### 3. **Component Coupling**
- **Challenge**: AI initially created large, monolithic components
- **Solution**: Requested refactoring into smaller, focused components
- **Best Practice**: Each component handles a single responsibility

### AI Validation Approach

#### 1. **Code Review Process**
- Always reviewed AI-generated code before integration
- Verified business logic against requirements
- Ensured security best practices were followed

#### 2. **Testing Strategy**
- Manual testing of all user flows
- Cross-browser compatibility checks
- Responsive design validation on multiple devices

#### 3. **Performance Optimization**
- Reviewed AI suggestions for performance implications
- Optimized database queries and component rendering
- Implemented proper React optimization patterns

### Recommendations for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple components and gradually add complexity
2. **Validate Early**: Test AI-generated code immediately after implementation
3. **Understand the Code**: Don't just copy-paste; understand what the AI created
4. **Iterate Frequently**: Use AI for rapid iterations and improvements
5. **Security First**: Always review security implications of AI suggestions
